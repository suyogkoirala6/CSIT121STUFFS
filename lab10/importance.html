<h1>Why WCAG 2.1 is Important?</h1>

    <p>WCAG 2.1 is important because it ensures that websites are fully accessible to all individuals,
    including people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities. When websites follow
    accessibility rules, everyone can read, understand, and interact with the content, even if they use
    assistive tools such as screen readers, braille displays, or voice navigation. Accessible design
    helps prevent discrimination and supports equal access to digital information, which is a basic
    expectation in today's online world.
    </p>

    <p>
     Beyond ethics and inclusivity, WCAG compliance is required by laws such as the Americans with
     Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 in the United States. Organizations that follow WCAG
    reduce legal risks and improve usability for all visitors - including mobile users, seniors,
    and people with temporary disabilities. WCAG 2.1also helps websites perform better overall by creating 
    cleaner structure, clearer text, and more predictable navigation.
