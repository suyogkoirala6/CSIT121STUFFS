    <p>
       The W3C web standard, Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) enables web applications to play encrypted audio and video through 
       built-in browser capabilities through its official JavaScript API. The W3C published EME as a Recommendation on September 18th, 2017, 
       before releasing subsequent updates through the Editor's Draft in 2019. The standard replaced previous browser plugins including 
       Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight and NPAPI-based playback systems which used to play DRM-protected media content.
    </p>

    <p>
        The EME system enables secure content playback through native browser integration with HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; elements. 
        The EME system does not determine which encryption methods to use or which DRM systems to implement or digital licenses to apply. 
        The browser uses EME to establish communication with a Content Decryption Module (CDM) which handles both decryption operations and 
        content playback restrictions defined by content providers. The following list shows examples of Content Decryption Modules (CDMs):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Widevine (Chrome, Android, Firefox)</li>
        <li>Microsoft PlayReady (Edge, Windows)</li>
        <li>Apple FairPlay (Safari, iOS, macOS)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        EME functions as a common interface which enables video websites to connect with the browser-based DRM system through its separate operation. 
        The system gives developers a standardized method to obtain keys and manage decryption licenses and manage playback restrictions and control 
        encrypted media sessions. The system enables protected content playback through secure devices while maintaining copyright protection.
