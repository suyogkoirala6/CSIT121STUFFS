    </header>

    <p>
       The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 are an internationally recognized set of standards
       developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that digital content is accessible to everyone, 
       including people with disabilities. These guidelines focus on making websites more usable for individuals 
       with visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive impairments, as well as improving accessibility on mobile devices. 
       WCAG 2.1 builds upon earlier versions by introducing additional success criteria that address modern technology, 
       touchscreens, low-vision needs, and assistive tools like screen readers.
    </p>

    <p>
        WCAG 2.1 builds on previous versions by adding more guidelines focused on mobile accessibility, visual impairments, 
        and cognitive disabilities. By following WCAG 2.1, developers create content that is Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, 
        and Robust-principles known as POUR. These standards not only promote inclusivity but also support legal compliance, improve 
        user experience, and help websites reach a wider audience. In today's digital world, WCAG 2.1 serves as a critical framework 
        for building ethical, accessible, and user-friendly web experiences.
    </p>

    <h2>POUR Principles</h2>
    <p>
        WCAG 2.1 is built on four core principles known as <strong>POUR</strong>. These principles describe
        what makes content accessible for people with different disabilities.
    </p>

    <h3>P : Perceivable</h3>
    <p>
        Information and user interface components must be presented in ways people can <strong>perceive</strong>,
        meaning nothing is invisible to all of their senses.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text alternatives for images (<code>alt</code> text)</li>
        <li>Captions for videos</li>
        <li>High color contrast</li>
        <li>Content that can be resized without breaking</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>O : Operable</h3>
    <p>
        Users must be able to <strong>operate</strong> the interface, regardless of how they interact with the web
        (keyboard, mouse, assistive tech).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Entire site can be used with a keyboard</li>
        <li>Buttons and links are large enough to tap</li>
        <li>No flashing content that triggers seizures</li>
        <li>Clear navigation and focus indicators</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>U : Understandable</h3>
    <p>
        Content and navigation must be <strong>easy to understand</strong>, predictable, and consistent.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear instructions and simple language</li>
        <li>Consistent layouts across pages</li>
        <li>Input fields with labels</li>
        <li>Helpful error messages</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>R : Robust</h3>
    <p>
        Content must work reliably with a wide range of <strong>technology</strong>, including assistive tools like
        screen readers.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proper HTML structure and tags</li>
        <li>ARIA labels when needed</li>
        <li>Code that follows web standards and avoids errors</li>
        <li>Compatibility across browsers and devices</li>
    </ul>
