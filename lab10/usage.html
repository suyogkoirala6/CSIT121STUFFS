    <h1>How WCAG 2.1 Is Used?</h1>

<p>
    WCAG 2.1 is used as a practical guide for creating websites that everyone can access, including 
    people with disabilities, mobile users, seniors, and even people with temporary limitations 
    (like a broken arm or bright sunlight on their screen). Developers, designers, and organizations 
    use these guidelines as a checklist during the planning, coding, and testing stages of a website. 
    WCAG makes sure that content is easy to read, simple to navigate, and compatible with assistive 
    technologies like screen readers.
</p>

<p>
    Many schools, government websites, and large companies follow WCAG 2.1 to ensure their digital 
    content meets accessibility standards. For students and beginners learning web development, WCAG 
    helps build good habits early—such as using proper headings, writing descriptive alt text, 
    choosing readable colors, and structuring HTML correctly. These practices not only help users 
    with disabilities but also make websites cleaner, more professional, and easier for everyone to use.
</p>
<h2>Examples of How WCAG 2.1 is Applied</h2>
 
<h3>A. Adding Alt Text to Images</h3>
<p>
    Alt text describes what an image shows. This is important for people using screen readers or 
    when an image fails to load. Good alt text helps users understand the purpose of the image.
</p>
<pre>&lt;img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo"&gt;</pre>

<h3>B. Using Proper Heading Structure</h3>
<p>
    Headings must be used in order (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to give pages a clear hierarchy. This helps 
    screen readers understand the layout and helps all users quickly scan the content.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Main Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Section&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subsection&lt;/h3&gt;
</pre>

<h3> C. Providing Keyboard Navigation</h3>
<p>
    Some users cannot use a mouse, so WCAG requires that all interactive elements can be reached 
    with keyboard keys like TAB, Enter, and the Arrow keys. Buttons, links, and forms should all 
    be accessible without a mouse.
</p>

<h3>D. Ensuring Good Color Contrast</h3>
<p>
    Text needs enough contrast from its background so users can read it easily. WCAG recommends 
    at least a 4.5:1 ratio for normal text. This is especially helpful for people with low vision 
    or color blindness.
</p>

<h3>E. Adding Labels to Form Fields</h3>
<p>
    Labels help users understand what information they need to enter in a form, especially those 
    using screen readers. Without labels, some users may not know what a text box is for.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;label for="email"&gt;Email Address:&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="email" id="email" name="email"&gt;
</pre>

<h3>F. Using Descriptive Link Text</h3>
<p>
    Instead of writing “Click here,” WCAG recommends descriptive links so users know where the link 
    will take them. This is especially useful for screen reader users.
</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="sources.html"&gt;Sources&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<h3>G. Making a Site Mobile-Friendly</h3>
<p>
    WCAG 2.1 added new guidelines for smartphones and tablets, such as making buttons large enough 
    to tap and preventing the page from zoom-locking. This improves usability for all mobile users.
</p>

<h3>H. Providing Clear Instructions and Error Messages</h3>
<p>
    When users fill out a form incorrectly, WCAG requires helpful error messages so they know 
    exactly how to fix the problem. This reduces frustration and prevents mistakes.
