                My interest includes playing soccer, which strengthens teamwork and displine, as well as adventure that helps me be with myself for short period of time and relaxes me from the academic burden once in a while.
                I also enjoy playing video games for focus on my strategy logic. And I do read books sometimes that expand my knowledge.
