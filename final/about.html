            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <img src="images/store.jpg" alt="Old Store where Bean and Bloom Café  Started" class="logo">
            <p>
                Bean & Bloom Café  was founded in 1998 by an immigrant from Germany named
                <strong>Manuel Neuer</strong>. What began as a small convenience market, Up Top Store, 
                slowly evolved into a cozy neighborhood spot where people could grab a warm drink,
                talk, and relax. Over time, Suyog transformed that corner shop into a full Café ,
                blending his roots, hard work, and love for people into every cup.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Bean & Bloom Café  serves students, office workers, and neighbors who stop in
                for strong coffee, fresh pastries, and a calm place to recharge. The goal is simple:
                keep the welcoming spirit of that first shop while constantly growing, learning,
                and brewing something better for the community.
