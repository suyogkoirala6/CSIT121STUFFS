                This is my first webpage. I found that working with HTML wasn't very stressful because I had already learned it in 10th grade. However, the real challenge came with uploading assignments to the GitHub repository.
            The process of managing version control and ensuring everything was correctly uploaded gave me more difficulty but I figured it out anyway. In addition, learning the basics of HTML, I've developed a clear understanding 
            of how to organize a web page using different HTML elements. Secondly, I've learned how  to use semantic tags to enhance the meaning and structure of the content.</p>
            <h3>Key things learned</h3>
