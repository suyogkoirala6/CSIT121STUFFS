            <h2>Lab 01 & 02 : HTML Basics</h2> 
            <p><i>Published on September 21, 2025 by Suyog Koirala</i></p>
            <p>This is my first webpage. I found that working with HTML wasn't very stressful because I had already 
                learned it in 10th grade. However, the real challenge came with uploading assignments to the GitHub 
                repository.The process of managing version control and ensuring everything was correctly uploaded gave 
                me more difficulty but I figured it out anyway. In addition, learning the basics of HTML, I've developed 
                a clear understanding of how to organize a web page using different HTML elements. Secondly, I've learned 
                how  to use semantic tags to enhance the meaning and structure of the content.</p>
            
                <h3>Key things learned</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learned to structure a webpage from scratch using semantic HTML tags like header, main, and footer.</li>
                <li>Understood the importance of proper file organization and version control when uploading to GitHub.</li>
                <li>Practiced creating a clear content hierarchy using headings and paragraphs for better readability.</li>
                <li>Discovered that HTML gives meaning to content, not just visual layout.</li>
                <li>Gained a strong foundation for moving on to CSS.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lab 03 : CSS Basics</h2>
            <p><i>Published on September 28, 2025 by Suyog Koirala</i></p>
            <p>This week, I learned the basis of CSS, including how to style HTML elements with colors, fonts
                and backgrounds. Additionally, I explored semantic HTML tags, which help improve accessibilty
                and search engine optimization by providing meaning to the structure of a webpage. I realized 
                the importance of maintaining clean and organized code. As I added new styles, I had to ensure 
                my CSS selectors were efficient and that my HTML remained semantic, making it easier to read and modify later.</p>
            
                <h3>Key things learned</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learned to separate content from presentation using external stylesheets.</li>
                <li>Practiced CSS selectors, colors, fonts, and the box model to improve layout and design.</li>
                <li>Discovered how small styling changes can make big visual differences.</li>
                <li>Focused on accessibility by ensuring clear color contrast and readable text.</li>
                <li>Realized that good design is about simplicity, consistency, and usability.</li>

            <h2>Lab 05: Responsive Design</h2>
            <p><i>Published on Oct 23, 2025 by Suyog Koirala</i></p>
            <p>This week, I struggled a bit with getting my layout to adjust properly on different screen sizes.
               At first, my text and images didn't align well when switching from mobile to desktop view. I had 
               to experiment with grid properties and media queries to fix spacing and alignment issues.Through this, 
               I learned how powerful CSS Grid can be for building flexible layouts and how media queries let me control 
               design for different devices. I also realized the importance of testing the site in various screen widths 
               to make sure everything stays readable and visually balanced. Overall, I gained confidence in creating 
               responsive, user-friendly web pages that look good on any device.</p>
            
            <h3>Key things learned</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learned to make web pages responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.</li>
                <li>Used CSS Grid to create flexible layouts that adapt to screen size.</li>
                <li>Added internal navigation with anchor links for better user experience.</li>
                <li>Practiced media queries to switch from single-column to multi-column layouts.</li>
                <li>Understood that responsive design is about user comfort and accessibility, not just resizing.</li>
            </ul>
